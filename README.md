# Operating System
Simple boot sector written in x86\_64 Assembly. Prints a string and hangs.

## Required packages
- make (For makefile)
- nasm (For compiling binary)
- qemu (For emulation)
- cdrtools (For generating ISO)

## Cloning and execution
#### Clone repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/manankarnik/operating-system.git
```

#### Change branch
```sh
git checkout 03-print-function
```

#### Change directory
```sh
cd operating-system
```

#### Compile binary
Uses nasm to compile to bin
```sh
make
```

#### Emulate
Uses qemu-system-x86\_64 to emulate boot sector
```sh
make run
```

#### Generate ISO
ISO can be attached to virtualbox (not tested on hardware)
```sh
make iso
```

#### Delete generated files
Removes all iso and bin files generated by make
```sh
make clean
```
